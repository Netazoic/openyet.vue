For this reason \r\n            the death count can only be used in conjunction with the confirmed cases count and the % positive tests numbers. If the death \r\n            count disagrees with these other criteria, it must be regarded as suspect.</li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n\r\n      <h3>Other Criterea</h3>\r\n        <p>Other criterea are listed in the U.S. Federal guidelines that are not used here. These include:\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li>Downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses reported within a 14-day period</li>\r\n                <li>Downward trajectory of covid-like syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period</li>\r\n                <li>Hospitals able to treat all patients without crisis care</li>\r\n                <li>'Robust' testing programs in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n\r\n            The first three of these are healthcare-related numbers or conditions that have proven difficult to measure reliably. \r\n            \r\n            For example, this statement from the <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data\">Covid Tracking Project website</a>:\r\n\r\n            <blockquote>\r\n                States are currently reporting two fundamentally unlike statistics: \r\n                    current hospital/ICU admissions and cumulative hospitalizations/ICU admissions. \r\n                    Across the country, this reporting is also sparse. In short: it is impossible to assemble \r\n                    anything resembling the real statistics for hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or ventilator usage across the United States. \r\n                    As a result, we will no longer provide national-level summary hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or ventilator usage statistics on our site.\r\n\r\n                <p>We will continue tracking these numbers on a state-by-state basis, but it does not feel responsible to continue to display \r\n                    these US-wide statistics for a general audience. These heavily caveated numbers will remain in the API for advanced data users</p>\r\n            </blockquote>\r\n\r\n            <p>Without reliable numbers publicly available we are not able to include these in our analysis.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>The fourth criteria, 'Robust' testing, is perhaps more measurable - we could define it as minimum number of tests administered per 1M in population for example.\r\n                However, exactly what that standard would be is currently the subject of debate. We are not currently including it as a criteria but may revisit this\r\n                if an agreed definition arises as to what constitutes an acceptable level of testing.</p>\r\n        \r\n        <h2>Data Sources</h2> \r\n        <p>We are using two main data sources:</p>\r\n        <h3>Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University</h3>\r\n          <a name=\"data-johns-hopkins\"/>\r\n            <p><a href=\"https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19\">https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19</a></p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>The Covid Tracking Project</h3>\r\n                <a name=\"data-covid-tracking-project\"/>\r\n            <p><a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/\">https://covidtracking.com/</a></p>\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n    data(){\r\n        return{}\r\n    }    \r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n<style scoped>\r\nblockquote {\r\n    padding:30px;\r\n    margin: 0px 30px;\r\n    background-color:#C0C0C0;\r\n    color:white;\r\n}\r\n</style>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Methodology.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Methodology.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Methodology.vue?vue&type=template&id=9f2589a0&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./Methodology.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Methodology.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./Methodology.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=9f2589a0&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"9f2589a0\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Methodology.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=9f2589a0&scoped=true&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Methodology.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=9f2589a0&scoped=true&lang=css&\""],"sourceRoot":""}
